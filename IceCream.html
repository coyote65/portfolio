		<p class="welcome">Welcome to my endeavors of ice cream in New York City. Check out some of the places I have visited and recommended flavors.</p> 
		
		<p class="softswerve"><b><a href="http://www.softswervenyc.com/"><img class="softswerve" src="softswerve.jpg"></a>Soft Swerve:</b></p>
		
		<p class="softaddress"><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Soft+Swerve+Ice+Cream/@40.718203,-73.9934371,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c259870dc684ab:0x4e56d7e2f5f179ad!8m2!3d40.718199!4d-73.9912484">85B Allen St, New York, NY, 10002 </a></p>
		
		<p class="soft">Soft Swerve Ice Cream was the first ice cream spot I visited when I began my journey as a foodie.
		They have 4 flavors which are: Ube Purple Yam, Almond Cookie, Matcha Green Tea and Black Sesame. You can choose from various toppings and two cone flavors. They have customized specials in their menu with set swirl flavor, cone and toppings.
		My recommended and favorite swirl flavor is Ube Purple Yam. </p>
		
		<p class="eggloo"><b><a href="https://www.myeggloo.com/"><img class="eggloo" src="Eggloo.jpg"></a> Eggloo:</b></p>
		
		<p class="eggaddress"><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Eggloo/@40.7155348,-74.0015628,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25a27203e593f:0x2162ffffbbb91668!8m2!3d40.7155308!4d-73.9993741"> 60 Mulberry St, New York, NY 10013 </a></p>
		
		<p class="egg"> Eggloo is the second ice cream spot I have visited and I have been here multiple times. They specialize in Hong Kong egg waffles of three flavors which are Original, Chocolate and Green Tea. You have an option of either a soft swerve or scoops of various ice cream flavors inside the egg waffle. On top of that they give you choices for toppings and drizzles. The egg waffle absorbs the flavors of toppings, drizzles and ice cream itself and the waffle at the end tastes amazing. They do have other options available as well. </p>

		<p class="taiyakipar"> Taiyaki Ice Cream is most famous for their fish shaped cone. It is not just simply a cone but it has magic inside of it. When I visited their Baxter St location, I had the unicorn. The image to your right is how it looks. They have many other flavors of soft swerve that I have yet to try. In Addition, beverages with a unicorn floatie are also their specialty. They have expanded and opened up two location in New York City, one in Florida and one in Toronto, Canada. </p>

		<p class="mcpar"> Milk And Cream Cereal Bar is one of my favorite spot. As the name suggests they are heavy on cereals. You have an option of ice cream swirl, ice cream and cereal mixed milkshake, and a cereal bowl. You'll be confused as to which toppings and flavors should you pick just like I was. For our convinience, they have signature combos which has customized flavors and toppings. The image to your right is Cookie Crisp Carnival. That's what I tried on my last trip there. For Customers they also have pints available. Their environment is very appealing as well. Make sure to check out this place when you are in China Town or SoHo. </p>

		<p class="barpar"> Bar Pa Tea is a bubble tea spot. You may be wondering why a bubble tea place is on an ice cream page? Actually, They serve ice cream as well. What makes this place important is their fusion of tea and ice cream. You can actually add bubbles in your soft swerve. They are more known for their bubble tea but definitely give their soft swerve a try. A unique feature of their bubble tea is that it shows two color and they are two different flavors. Bar Pa Tea provides a menu of highly customizable drinks, allowing the customer to adjust sweetness in increments and choose whether they would prefer it hot or cold. Bar Pa Tea even offers alternatives to the traditional tapioca pearls, most notably their signature "miniature bubbles".</p>

		<p class="magnumpar"> Magnum opens seasonally from June to End of August. When I moved back to United States from Pakistan, i looked for Magnum in stores and I could not find it. I was surprised they don't have a location here. Thankfully, i found last year a pop up location they had in New York City. Magnum customizes Ice Cream bar of your choosing in front of you. I have seen people lined up outisde just for their ice cream bar. Out of all the ice cream locations I have visited this place had lowest price. </p>

Also, their chocolate shots are most famous. It also offers a collection of books too. It is 2 blocks away from 14th St Union Square Station. </p>

		<p class="malaipar"> The name sparked my interested to visit this location as Malai in Urdu means "Cream". As I thought this place is established a desi woman. The ice creams itself had a unique flavoring to it. Ice cream flavors here are robustly flavored using some of the spices like ginger, nutmeg, cardamon, and saffron. It may sound odd but its taste was amazing. I purchased two flavors Mango and Cream and Turkish Coffee. I have also tried Rose with Cinnamon Roasted Almonds. They are newly place so feel make check it out. </p>
